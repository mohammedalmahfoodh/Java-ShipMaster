To change the default limits for the ERROR.TXT and TRACE.TXT log files.

Put a file in the app-path folder named Logsini.txt

Example of file contents (2 lines):

"TraceLogSizeLimit","50000"
"ErrorLogSizeLimit","10000"

Defaults: (if no Logsini.txt is present)

TraceLogSizeLimit = 5000
ErrorLogSizeLimit = 3000

Values in bytes!

When the limit is reached, the log file will be renamed with the extension .full.txt
and a new empty log file will be created.
