# EMAF Constant (a) - The degree of weighting decrease is expressed as a constant smoothing factor a,
# a number between 0 and 1,
# The smoothing factor may be expressed as a percentage,
# so a value of 10% is equivalent to (a) = 0.1,
# A higher (a) discounts older observations faster,
"EMAFConstant","0.4"

# If no calculation has been triggered then force calculation at this time,
"ForceCalcTime","5"
# skip Calculation Time (S),
# Skip all calculations up until this time,
